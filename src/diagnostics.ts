/*
 * Diagnostics — modeled on scriptc's banded error-code system.
 *
 * Bands:
 *   NT0xxx  parse/preflight (syntax we can't read)
 *   NT1xxx  valid TypeScript we don't compile YET (the coverage gradient)
 *   NT2xxx  our type rules (real user type errors)
 *   NT9xxx  internal compiler error
 *
 * Every rejection of *supported-but-unimplemented* TS should use an NT1xxx code
 * with a milestone + hint, so `nativets coverage` can turn "unsupported" into an
 * actionable, prioritized list instead of an opaque wall.
