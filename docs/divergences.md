# Divergences & unsupported features

### THE HEADLINE DIVERGENCE — an out-of-bounds index PANICS

In JS an out-of-range read is *defined*: `a[5]` on a 3-element array is `undefined`, and an
out-of-range write to a typed array is a silent no-op. **nativets aborts instead.**

```
panic: index out of bounds: the length is 3 but the index is 5
  at examples/thing.ts:12:9
  help: array index is out of range; use `.at(5)` to get `undefined` instead of panicking
```

on **stderr** (stdout is flushed first and stays byte-comparable), via `abort()` — SIGABRT, so
a shell sees **exit code 134**, the same path as `nativets: out of memory`.

**Why, given that node is the oracle.** Every indexed accessor in the runtime is bounds-checked,
so nativets never performs an out-of-bounds *memory* access — that part was never in question.
What was wrong was the **policy on a failed check**: it returned a benign value (`nt_arr_get` →
`0`, `js_str_char_at` → `""`, `nt_bytes_get` → `0`, an OOB `Uint8Array` write → nothing,
`nt_pv_update` out of range → an unchanged copy). Measured, that matched **neither** node **nor**
a trap:

| | nativets (before) | node |
|---|---|---|
| `a[5]` on `[1,2,3]` | `0` | `undefined` |
| `a[-1]` | `0` | `undefined` |
| `"abc"[7]` | `""` | `undefined` |
| `u[9] = 1` on a 4-byte array | silently ignored | silently ignored |

A wrong-but-plausible `0` is the worst outcome available: the program keeps running and computes
a wrong answer from a value that was never there. Memory safety is supposed to mean *a guaranteed
controlled stop*, never *continuing into a phantom value*. Reproducing node's `undefined` would
mean making every element read nullable (`T | undefined`) — the whole language pays a tagged-pair
box on every index so that a bug can be *quietly propagated*. So we take the third option, the one
Rust takes: stop, loudly, at the exact source location.

Rules:

- **Covered accessors:** array read `a[i]`, string index `s[i]`, `Uint8Array` read `u[i]` **and
  write** `u[i] = v` (including compound `u[i] += v`), and `arr.with(i, v)` (flat *and* past the
  32-element persistent-trie threshold — node throws a `RangeError` here, so node stops too).
  **Negative indices panic everywhere** (they are not Python-style wrap-around).
- **A panic is NOT an exception.** It deliberately does not go through the Stage-20
  pending-exception protocol: `try { a[5] } catch {}` still aborts, and a `finally` does not run.
  It stops the program; it is not a control-flow construct.
- **`.at(i)` is the node-exact escape hatch** and is unchanged: it returns `T | undefined`
  (`a.at(5)` → `undefined`, `a.at(-1)` → the last element), matching node byte for byte. It is the
  documented way to ask "give me `undefined` instead of panicking", which is what the panic's
  `help:` line names. `String#charAt(i)` is likewise untouched — node *defines* it as `""` out of
  range, so it is not a defect and does not panic.
- **Compile-time beats runtime.** When the length and the index are both statically known — a
  literal array/string, or a `const` bound to one, indexed by a numeric literal — the program is
  **rejected** with **`NT2002`** (`index 5 is out of bounds for an array of length 3`) rather than
  built and aborted. It is a real user error, hence the NT2xxx type-error band rather than the
  NT1xxx "not yet implemented" gradient, and `coverage` surfaces it.
- **Only written indices panic.** Compiler-generated in-bounds reads (`for-of`, the array HOFs,
  `JSON.stringify`, destructuring, spread-call expansion) keep the internal non-panicking
  accessor, so nothing pays twice and in-bounds programs are behaviourally unchanged.

### stdlib Batch 1 — what cannot match node, and what we do instead

The Batch-1 stdlib (`docs/stdlib.md`) is node-differential everywhere except these, all of
which are **refusals or already-documented consequences**, never approximations:

- **In-place array mutators are refused** — `.fill`, `.sort`, `.splice`, `.shift`, `.unshift`,
  `.copyWithin` join `.push`/`.pop` under **`NT1606`** (arrays are immutable, Stage 29), each
  with a hint naming the immutable replacement. `.sort`'s hint points at the ES2023 copying
  form `.toSorted()` (delivered by the ordering lane, not this one).
- **String index space is UTF-8 bytes** (§A.2 above): `.charCodeAt`, `.at` and string indices
  address BYTES, so for non-ASCII they differ from node's UTF-16 code units (`"é".charCodeAt(0)`
  is `195` here, `233` in node). `.codePointAt` *decodes* the UTF-8 sequence, so it returns the
  same code point as node. ASCII is identical throughout; the non-ASCII behavior is pinned
  behaviorally in `test/stdlib-batch1.test.ts`.
- **`.replace`/`.replaceAll` accept STRING patterns only** — there is no `RegExp` (Tier C). The
  `$$`/`$&`/``$` ``/`$'` replacement substitutions are supported; capture-group `$1` is literal,
  as it is in node for a string pattern.
- **`toFixed(digits)` / `toString(radix)` require a literal argument** in range (`0..100` /
  `2..36`). node throws a `RangeError` outside those; we make the program **not compile**
  instead of emulating the throw. The formatting itself is exact (ECMAScript ToFixed; V8's
  `DoubleToRadixCString`).
- **`Object.entries` needs a string-valued object**, and **`Object.fromEntries` needs literal
  entries** — a `[string, number]` pair is a mixed-type tuple (our arrays are homogeneous) and
  object keys must be compile-time known. Both are `NT1002` refusals with hints.
- **`Array#at` / `Array#find` / `#findLast` are restricted to scalar elements** — handing back a
  heap element would alias its owner under the linear model (`NT1001`).
- **`Date.now()` is not node-differential** (a clock read): it is tested behaviorally —
  monotonic, whole milliseconds, plausible epoch range.

### Modules (SH1) — a whole-program link, and no import cycles

`import`/`export` across `.ts` files are compiled by resolving the graph from the entry file and
merging every module into ONE program (`src/modules.ts`). For an **acyclic** graph this matches
node exactly — same evaluation order (post-order DFS), each module's top level run **once**, same
bindings. Two deliberate differences:

- **Import cycles are refused** (`NT1702`, naming the cycle). ESM permits them via live bindings
  and a TDZ; a whole-program link has no such machinery, so we reject rather than pick an order
  that silently differs from node. Break the cycle with a third shared module.
- **Only relative `./`/`../` specifiers with an explicit extension resolve.** There is no
  `node_modules`/bare-specifier resolution, no `export default`, no `import * as ns`, no
  `export * from`, and no dynamic `import()` — each is `NT1017` with a hint naming the supported
  form. (`NT1701` = unreadable module, `NT1703` = no such export.)

`node` is our oracle. Two kinds of "we differ from node" exist, tracked separately.

## A. Semantic divergences (we compile it, but differ deliberately)

These are consequences of the **static-typing** design. Small in number; pinned by the
conformance corpus allow-lists.

### 1. Value-returning `&&` / `||` — same-type operands only
JS returns an *operand* of possibly-different type. As of A2 we support **value-returning
`&&`/`||` when both operands share a type** (`0 || 5 → 5`, `"" || "x" → "x"`, matching node),
which the `??`-vs-`||` test vectors require. **Mixed-type** logical expressions
(`true && 0`, `false || "hi"`) remain a type error — we don't unify across types. `??` is
sentinel/tag-based (A2): `0 ?? 5 → 0`, unlike `||`. Boolean logic (`a > b && c`, `!flag`)
matches node exactly. Corpus: `logical-and-shortcircuit`, `logical-or-shortcircuit`.

### Immutable `Map`/`Set` (B2) — the "sharp turn" away from JS

nativets `Map`/`Set` are **immutable/persistent** (ROADMAP Phase B): `.set`/`.add`/`.delete`
return a **new** collection sharing structure, leaving the source unchanged — unlike JS's mutable
Map/Set. Consequences vs node: (1) *old version unchanged* is the headline divergence, tested
behaviorally (compile+run+assert), not via the node oracle; (2) `.delete` returns a **new
collection**, where node returns a **boolean**; (3) ~~`.get` of an absent key returns `0`~~ **RESOLVED**: `.get` now returns `V | undefined`
via the A2 nullable machinery (miss → `undefined`, node-matched byte-for-byte). Fixtures
use the *use-the-returned-handle* pattern, whose observable output matches node.

### Map/Set iteration: insertion-ordered (node-matched), but the iterators are arrays

Iteration **order matches node exactly** — node guarantees insertion order and the runtime keeps
a persistent insertion-order key log next to the (hash-ordered) HAMT, honoring node's rules:
re-`set`ting an existing key keeps its original position, `delete` + re-insert moves it to the
end. Supported: `for (const k of m.keys())`, `.values()`, `for (const [k, v] of m.entries())`,
`for (const [k, v] of m)`, `for (const v of set)` / `set.values()`, plus `Array.from(it)` and
`[...it]`.

The divergence: `m.keys()` is a **real array** here, where node returns a lazy **Map Iterator**
object. In `for-of` / `Array.from` / `[...]` the two are indistinguishable — everywhere else they
are not (`m.keys().length` is `3` for us, `undefined` in node). Rather than diverge silently, an
iterator is **only typed in those three positions**; anywhere else it is refused (`NT1014`).
Likewise refused, all with the working spelling in the hint:
- `for (const x of m)` / `[...m]` / `Array.from(m)` with a **single** binding — node yields a
  `[key, value]` **pair array** and we have no tuple type; use `for (const [k, v] of m)`.
- `.entries()` outside the `[k, v]` loop (same reason).
- `.forEach` on a Map/Set — use the (identically ordered) `for-of`.

### Ordering: `.toSorted()`/`.toReversed()` instead of `.sort()`/`.reverse()`

node's `.sort()` sorts **in place**, which the immutable-by-default model forbids, so `.sort()`
is refused with `NT1606` pointing at **`.toSorted()`** — the ES2023 *copying* method, which is
non-mutating in node too, so **node stays the oracle** (no divergence in what we do compile).
`.toSorted()`, `.toSorted(cmp)` and `.toReversed()` are node-matched: the default comparator
compares the elements' **string** forms (`[10, 9, 1].toSorted()` → `1, 10, 9`), and the sort is
**stable** (a merge sort), as node's is required to be. A comparator may be any function value
(inline arrow or a captured closure); its result is mapped to a sign, with `NaN` treated as `0`
like node. (`.reverse()` still mutates — pre-existing, flagged above.)

### String relational compare (`<` `<=` `>` `>=`) is UTF-8 byte order

node compares strings by **UTF-16 code units**; we compare our UTF-8 bytes (`strcmp`), which is
**code-point** order. The two agree for the entire BMP up to U+FFFF *except* when an astral
character (≥ U+10000) is compared against one in U+E000–U+FFFF at the same position: UTF-16 puts
the astral string first (its lead surrogate is 0xD800–0xDBFF), code-point order puts it last. All
ASCII and ordinary non-ASCII text (accents, CJK) matches node exactly. Same rule applies to the
default `.toSorted()` on `string[]` and to `String#length` (see §2 below).

### Immutable-by-default: in-place mutation is rejected (B2, the "sharp turn")

Arrays and objects are **immutable**. In-place mutation is **refused** with `NT1606` (reject-don't-
miscompile), pointing at the immutable replacement:
- `arr.push(x)` / `arr.pop()` → use `[...arr, x]` (node's `.push` returns a length, `.pop` an
  element; rejecting avoids a silent semantic divergence).
- `arr[i] = v` (and compound `arr[i] += v`) → use `arr.with(i, v)`.
- `o.f = v` → use `{ ...o, f: v }`.

This is a deliberate divergence from node (which mutates). The immutable API is node-matched:
`arr.with(i, v)` is real ES2023, and spread runs identically on node. ~~`.with` does a full copy~~
**RESOLVED (B2 step 2)**: past 32 elements `.with` and the leading-spread append `[...a, x]` are
backed by a **refcounted persistent vector trie** and copy only the root→leaf path — O(log32 n) /
O(1) amortized instead of O(n), with the untouched subtrees shared by pointer. Not a behavioural
divergence: every observable (indexing, `.length`, `for-of`, HOF, `.join`, `.slice`, `.reverse`,
spread, `JSON.stringify`, `===`) stays byte-identical to node — see `test/sharing.test.ts`.
Consequence: `NT1603` iterator-
invalidation is now unreachable (you can't mutate during iteration if you can't mutate). `.reverse`
still mutates in place (which *matches* node, so not a divergence — but violates the frozen-value
spirit; slated to reject/copy-return later). Heap `===`/`!==` on arrays/objects is **reference
identity** (pointer comparison), matching JS `===` on objects.

### Strings are reference-counted, not linear (memory model)

Heap strings keep JS **value semantics** (free copy/alias) and are reclaimed by **reference
counting** — so, unlike arrays/objects (linear ownership + move-check), strings are **never**
move-checked: aliasing a string is always fine, no `NT1601` on strings. Reclamation is invisible to
behavior (rc is a memory-model detail); the only observable guarantee is no leak of heap strings
(`nt_str_live()` → 0). This supersedes the earlier "strings are linear" research direction.

### Actor receive timeouts run on a VIRTUAL clock (B3 v4)

`receive(ms)` / `receiveMatch(pred, ms)` are Erlang's `after`, but `ms` is measured on a **virtual
clock that only advances when the run queue is empty** — i.e. a timeout fires exactly when nothing
runnable could still send you a message, never by wall-clock sleeping. Consequences: (a) the value
of `ms` orders competing timeouts but does not make the program slower; (b) at quiescence *every*
pending timeout eventually fires, so a program whose only pending work is a long timeout completes
immediately instead of waiting. `ms <= 0` is Erlang's `after 0` — poll the mailbox, never block.
This is what keeps actor programs deterministic and their stdout byte-assertable.

### Actor messages are statically typed: `number | string` (B3 v4)

Messages travel through one 8-byte slot, so a message's type comes from the program, not the wire:
`const m: string = receive()` (the declared type), or the predicate's parameter type for
`receiveMatch`. Unannotated `receive()` is `number`. **String messages are deep-copied on send**
(isolation: the receiver never aliases the sender's buffer). Sending anything else — objects,
arrays, `Dyn` — is refused with a diagnostic (`NT1003`), never shipped without a deep copy. Because
sender and receiver are typed independently, each message also carries a runtime **kind tag**: a
receive compiled for `number` that meets a string aborts with a diagnostic on stderr (exit 70)
rather than reinterpreting the pointer — a runtime reject, never a miscompile.

### Actors are behavioral-tested, not node-differential (B3 v0)
node has no BEAM-style actor runtime, so `spawn`/`send`/`receive`/`self` programs can't use the
node oracle. They are verified by **running the native binary and asserting exact stdout**
(`test/actors/`) — deterministic under the single cooperative v0 scheduler; only **pairwise**
send-order is guaranteed. Actor programs are **host-verified only**: `nt_actor.c` uses `ucontext`,
absent from the Android NDK (API 24) — so the runtime is linked **only when a program uses
actors**, keeping the Android/iOS cross-build green for every non-actor program.

### 2. `String#length` / string ops are UTF-8 byte-oriented
We store strings as NUL-terminated UTF-8 and measure/slice by byte. Identical to JS for
ASCII (all fixtures); differs for non-ASCII (an emoji is 4 bytes here, 2 UTF-16 units in JS).

> `typeof undefined` (a former divergence) is now **supported** and matches node.

### 3. Pipeline operator `|>` (Elixir semantics, not TC39 Hack-style)
We implement `|>` (ROADMAP §B1) as a **pure parser desugar** with **Elixir semantics**:
`x |> f(a)` ≡ `f(x, a)` — the left operand is threaded as the **first argument** of the
right-hand call. It is the **loosest** expression operator (below `?:`/logical/comparison/
bitwise/arithmetic) and **left-associative**, so `a + b |> f() |> g(c)` → `g(f(a + b), c)`.

This deliberately diverges from the (unfinished) **TC39 Hack-style** proposal, which uses an
explicit topic token (`x |> f(%, a)`) placing the value wherever `%` appears. nativets has **no
topic token**. Rules (v1):
- The **RHS must be a call** whose callee is a **named function or a function-valued variable**.
  A bare identifier (`x |> f`), a non-call (`x |> y`, `x |> dbl() + 1`), or a member/method
  callee (`x |> obj.m()`) is a **clean parse error (NT0001)** — never a silent guess. We
  require the explicit call form `f()` (not F#-style tacit application) for one uniform rule.
- The value goes into **argument slot 0 only**; it cannot be placed in a later position or into
  multiple positions (those need the Hack topic and are intentionally unsupported).

**Oracle note:** `node` rejects `|>` outright today, so there is no oracle conflict yet; the
twin-file strategy (`test/pipeline/*.ts` + hand-desugared `*.twin.ts`, gated by
`test/pipeline.test.ts`) keeps a defined node oracle. If a Hack-style `|>` ever ships in
standard JS/TS, our `|>` will diverge from conforming TS (same token, different lowering) — this
entry is that pre-registered divergence.

### `dyn as T` performs runtime validation (io-ts/zod semantics)

`JSON.parse(s)` returns a dynamic `Dyn`; narrowing it with `x as T` emits a validator that
walks the value against `T`'s static shape and **throws a runtime `TypeError` on a mismatch**,
then hands back a statically-`T` value. tsc/node **erase** `as T` (zero runtime checks), so:

- **Success paths match node** byte-for-byte (ordinary differential fixtures,
  `test/fixtures/stage20/json-parse-*`).
- **Failure paths deliberately diverge:** where node's erased `as` silently yields
  `undefined`/`NaN`/garbage, nativets **throws** (uncaught → non-zero exit, empty stdout). These
  are asserted by fiat (not the node oracle) in `test/typecheck.test.ts`, compiletest-style.
  Extra object keys are **stripped** (ignored), matching zod's default / io-ts `t.type`; there is
  no `.strict()` reject mode. `null` and absent are distinct (a present `null` tag vs a missing
  key). No `.int()` / NaN concerns — `number` is one IEEE-754 `double`, and JSON can't produce
  `NaN`/`Infinity` literals.

**JSON.parse danger zones** (stdout + exit code are compared, never the `SyntaxError` message
text): D1 reject-message text is V8-specific; D2 an embedded ` ` truncates our NUL-terminated
strings; D3 `.length` counts UTF-8 bytes not UTF-16 units for non-ASCII; D6 surrogate-pair `\u`
escapes and lone surrogates are not yet decoded (BMP `\uXXXX` is); D7 `-0` prints `-0` on direct
print but `0` via `JSON.stringify`. A **compound `Dyn` printed directly** (`console.log(parsed)`
of an array/object) would need `util.inspect` emulation and is deferred — scalars print correctly.

### `async` / `await` are real syntax, but there is NO concurrency (networking tier)

nativets has no event loop and no promises. The decision (deliberate, and the reason `fetch`
exists at all): **`async` is erased and `await` is an identity pass-through over an
already-resolved value**, while `fetch` and every other I/O call **BLOCKS**. The payoff is that
ordinary idiomatic source —

```ts
const res = await fetch(url);
const body = await res.text();
```

— compiles here **and runs unchanged under `node`**, so node stays the byte-for-byte oracle for
networking (`test/fetch.test.ts` runs the same `.ts` under both, against a local mock server).

What this buys and what it costs:

- **Matches node** whenever the program is *sequential*: each `await` resumes with the same value
  in the same order, so stdout is identical.
- **No interleaving.** `await` never yields, so nothing else can run while a request is in flight.
  Anything whose meaning depends on that is **rejected with `NT1020`**, never silently
  serialized-but-claimed-parallel and never miscompiled:
  - `Promise.all` / `Promise.race` / any `Promise.*` static, and `new Promise(...)`;
  - `.then(...)` / `.catch(...)` / `.finally(...)` on any value;
  - calling an `async function` **without `await`** when its value is used, or when top-level code
    follows it (under node that yields a *Promise* and lets the rest of the program run first).
    The one allowed form is the canonical entrypoint `main();` as the **last** top-level statement —
    with nothing after it, node's suspend-and-resume and our run-it-now produce identical output.
  - The diagnostic points at the **actor model** (`spawn`/`send`/`receive`, Stage 22/27/31), which
    is nativets' concurrency primitive. Promises may simply be the wrong abstraction here.
- `Promise<T>` in **type position** is erased to `T` (as are `Awaited<T>` and friends), so
  `async function f(): Promise<User>` annotates exactly as it does in TS.

### `fetch` is host-only, and its Response is a narrow subset

`fetch` / `Response` / `Headers` are backed by libcurl (`runtime/nt_http.c`), linked **only when a
program calls them** — so every non-fetch program, and every iOS/Android cross-build, stays
curl-free. Consequences:

- **Platforms:** macOS/Linux **host only**. iOS/Android would need the platform HTTP stack
  (NSURLSession / OkHttp / cronet) — a follow-on, exactly like the existing `httpGet`/`httpPost`.
- **Supported surface:** `fetch(url)`, `fetch(url, { method, headers, body })`; `res.status`,
  `res.ok`, `res.headers`, `await res.text()`, `await res.json()`, `res.headers.get(name)`
  (case-insensitive, `string | null`), `res.headers.has(name)`. Everything else on the standard
  `Response`/`Headers`/`Request` (streams, `res.body`, `formData`, `blob`, `arrayBuffer`,
  `redirect`/`signal`/`AbortController`, `res.statusText`, iterating headers, constructing a
  `Request`/`Response`) is **not implemented** and rejected.
- **`init` is read statically** — `method`/`body` are strings and `headers` is an object of string
  values, so the wire header block is unrolled at compile time. An unknown `init` key is rejected
  rather than silently dropped.
- **`await res.json()` returns a `Dyn`**, so narrowing it with `as T` performs the same generated
  runtime validation (and same deliberate throw-on-mismatch divergence) as `JSON.parse` above.
- **Errors match node's shape, not its message:** a transport failure (DNS/refused/TLS) **throws**
  a catchable exception, like node's fetch rejecting; a non-2xx is a normal Response with
  `ok === false` (no throw), exactly like node. The thrown value here is our message string, not a
  `TypeError` object — so compare control flow, not `e`.
- **Repeated response headers:** `.get` returns the **last** occurrence (correct across redirects)
  rather than node's comma-joined list.
- A `Response` is a plain heap handle: it is neither linear nor reference-counted yet, so it rides
  the allocate-and-never-free placeholder (safe; may leak for the process lifetime).

## B. Unimplemented features (we refuse to compile — never miscompile)

Everything else we don't support is **rejected with an `NT1xxx` diagnostic**, not silently
miscompiled. Run `nativets coverage <file>` to see exactly what blocks a program, grouped by
code, milestone, and frequency. The catalog lives in `src/diagnostics.ts` (`NYI`):

| Code | Feature | Milestone | Needs |
|------|---------|-----------|-------|
| NT1001 | arrays: empty `[]`, nested/object element types, `console.log(arr)` | M1 | (basic `number[]`/`string[]` are ✅ supported) |
| NT1002 | objects: nested object fields, object methods | M1 | (flat objects, `.f`/`o["f"]`, `Object.keys`, `for-in` are ✅ supported) |
| NT1003 | arrow functions / function values / closures | M2 | captured environments |
| NT1004 | `try`/`catch`/`throw` | M2 | unwinding |
| NT1005 | `JSON` | M3 | `JSON.stringify` ✅ and `JSON.parse` + `dyn as T` runtime typecheck ✅ (scalars/objects/arrays, nested); code reused to reject un-validatable narrow targets (functions, unions) + compound `Dyn` direct-print |
| NT1006 | spread | M2 | arrays/objects |
| NT1007 | destructuring | M2 | arrays/objects |
| NT1008 | rest parameters | M2 | arrays |
| NT1009 | optional `?.()` call / `?.[]` index / general or >2-arm unions | M2 | `?.` on object fields, `??`, and restricted `T\|undefined`/`T\|null` are ✅ (A2); the reused code now rejects only the out-of-subset forms |
| NT1010 | `for-in` | M1 | objects |
| NT1011 | `for-of` over non-strings | M1 | arrays/iterables |
| NT1013 | generics | M3 | generic **functions** monomorphize ✅ (Stage 36) and type arguments erase ✅ (SH2); the code now rejects only the corners below |

### Generics — what M3 deliberately does NOT do (all rejected, never miscompiled)

Generic function definitions are compiled by **monomorphization**: one specialization per distinct
type-argument tuple, resolved from explicit call-site type args or inferred structurally from the
argument types. node runs the same source unchanged (it just strips annotations), so every
supported case is node-differential — there is **no runtime divergence**. The refusals:

- **Polymorphic recursion** — a generic whose self-call uses a *bigger* type argument
  (`f<T>` → `f<T[]>`) has no finite monomorphization. Capped at 200 instantiations, then
  `NT1013` (TypeScript itself accepts this; we reject rather than diverge).
- **A generic used as a value** (`const g = id;`) — specialization happens at the CALL site, so a
  generic has no single type to store. `NT1013`, with a hint to call it directly.
- **Uninferrable type arguments** (a type parameter that appears in no parameter, e.g.
  `function make<T>(): number`) — `NT1013`, with a hint to pass them explicitly (`make<string>()`),
  which IS supported.
- **Generic arrows are not monomorphized** — an arrow is a value, so `<T>(x: T) => …` takes its
  *contextual* parameter type when used as an argument (this works at any type), and otherwise
  falls back to the pre-M3 erasure of `T` to `number`. Using a standalone generic arrow at a
  non-number type is therefore a plain `NT2001` type error, not a miscompile.
- **Generic classes** (`class Box<T>`) — `NT1015` (classes are not monomorphized at all).
- **Constraints and defaults are erased** — `T extends U` / `T = U` are parsed and dropped;
  specialization is driven by the types that actually flow, so a constraint adds nothing, but it
  is also **not enforced** (a bound violation surfaces as an ordinary error inside the
  specialization, not as a constraint violation at the call site).
| NT1020 | promises / concurrency: `Promise.*`, `new Promise`, `.then`/`.catch`/`.finally`, un-awaited `async` results | later | an event loop — or, the chosen answer, the **actor** model (`spawn`/`send`/`receive`). `async`/`await`/`fetch` themselves are ✅ supported (blocking; see §A) |

The single biggest unlock is **M1 (a heap value model → arrays + objects)**, which in turn
unblocks much of M2. That is the next architectural push.

When a feature ships: delete its row here, move its corpus case out of `KNOWN_UNSUPPORTED`
in the relevant `test/*conformance*`/`test/gap.test.ts` allow-list, and drop the `NYI` entry.
